Project by : Linda Marwatul Ghina

Sales Dashboard Present :
- Total Sales : 88M
- There are 3 visualization on the dashboard. The first one is Sum of units sold by store region, the second one is sum of units sold by Month and the last one is sum of units sold by store. Below are the explanations of the visualization:
1. The highest Monthly Sales are in May to June while the lowest sales is in July
2. The highest selling store region is DKI Jakarta with 18M total sales, the lowest one is Jawa Barat with 10M total sales
3. For the sum of units sold by store is mostly stable

The sales strategy to support sales growth is to increase promotions and offer special deals to customers in DKI Jakarta. Additionally, despite lower sales in Jawa Barat, it presents an opportunity for business expansion. Consider opening more stores in the West Java region or enhancing the visibility of existing stores with the right marketing strategy.
